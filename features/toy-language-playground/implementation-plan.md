# Implementation Plan: Toy Language Playground

## Technical Context
- **Tech Stack**: Vanilla Vite TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Package Structure**: Will be created as a package in the packages directory
- **Core Integration**: Will import only the transpileSrc function from the @turacode/core package
- **Code Editor**: Will explore options with Monaco Editor as the leading candidate
- **Framework**: Will use vanilla JavaScript without any framework dependency

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 0: Research & Exploration ✅
- Research.md document created with analysis of code editor options
- Recommendation to use Monaco Editor for best VS Code extension integration

### Phase 1: Data Models & Contracts ✅
- Data model defined with PlaygroundState, TranspilationResult, and ExecutionResult
- Core package integration contract established
- Monaco Editor integration contract created

### Phase 2: Implementation Tasks ✅
- Comprehensive task list created with estimates and dependencies
- Critical path identified
- Potential risks and mitigations documented

## Implementation Decisions

### Code Editor Selection
Monaco Editor has been confirmed as the code editor solution because:
1. It provides the most direct path to using VS Code's TextMate grammar rules
2. It offers comprehensive editor features out of the box (syntax highlighting, line numbers, etc.)
3. Despite larger bundle size, the benefits in development time and feature completeness outweigh the costs
4. It will provide the most consistent syntax highlighting experience with the VS Code extension

### State Management
The application will use a custom lightweight state management solution with a simple pub/sub pattern:
1. A PlaygroundStore class will maintain the application state
2. Components can subscribe to state changes
3. Actions will update the state and notify subscribers
4. This approach avoids dependencies on external state management libraries

### Execution Strategy
Code execution will happen entirely in the browser by:
1. Transpiling the input code to JavaScript using the core package
2. Executing the transpiled code in a controlled environment
3. Capturing console output and errors
4. Displaying results in the result panel

### Responsive Design
The playground will use Tailwind's responsive utilities to implement:
1. A single-column layout on mobile devices with editor above results
2. A two-column layout on wider screens (768px+) with approximately 60/40 split for editor/results

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the package structure as defined in quickstart.md
2. Set up Monaco Editor integration with the Vite plugin
3. Create the Monaco Editor wrapper utility functions
4. Implement the custom language syntax highlighting for the toy language
5. Build the playground UI with the editor and output panels
6. Integrate with the @turacode/core package's transpileSrc function
7. Implement the execution environment for running the transpiled code
