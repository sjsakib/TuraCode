# Toy Language Playground

## Overview
This feature adds an interactive playground for the toy language. Users can write code in the editor, run it, and see the results immediately. The playground provides syntax highlighting using the VS Code extension's highlighting rules and displays the editor and results side by side on wider screens.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a title and brief description of the playground at the top of the page
- As a user, I want to write code in an editor with proper syntax highlighting
- As a user, I want to run my code by clicking a "Run" button
- As a user, I want to see the results of executing my code in a dedicated section
- As a user, I want the editor and results to be displayed side by side on wider screens

## Technical Details

### Components
1. **Playground Container**
   - Top-level component that contains all other elements
   - Responsive layout that switches between single-column and two-column view

2. **Header Section**
   - Title: "Toy Language Playground"
   - Brief description explaining the purpose and basic usage

3. **Code Editor**
   - Implements the syntax highlighting rules from the VS Code extension
   - Allows for writing and editing code
   - Uses a monospace font for code
   - Provides basic editor features (line numbers, etc.)

4. **Control Panel**
   - Contains a prominent "Run" button
   - Optional: Clear button, example selector, etc.

5. **Result Section**
   - Displays the output from transpiling and executing the code
   - Shows errors if they occur during transpilation or execution
   - Clear visual distinction from the editor section

### Implementation Details
- The editor will use a web-based code editor component that supports custom syntax highlighting
- The syntax highlighting rules will be extracted/adapted from the VS Code extension
- The transpiler from the existing codebase will be used to process the code
- The execution engine will run the transpiled code entirely in the browser and capture outputs
- No server-side code execution required
- Responsive design will use CSS Grid/Flexbox to manage the layout changes between different screen sizes

### API/Data Changes
- No database changes required
- No API endpoints needed as all execution happens client-side

## UI/UX Design
- Two-column layout on screens wider than 768px, with editor on the left and results on the right
- Single-column layout on smaller screens, with editor on top and results below
- Run button should be prominently displayed and easily accessible
- Clear visual feedback when code is running and when results are available
- Error messages should be clearly highlighted in the results section

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for the transpilation and execution functions
- Integration tests for the editor-transpiler-executor workflow
- UI tests for responsive behavior
- Manual testing across different browsers and devices

## Rollout Plan
1. Implement basic playground with minimal styling
2. Add syntax highlighting from VS Code extension
3. Implement transpilation and execution
4. Add responsive design for different screen sizes
5. Polish UI/UX based on feedback

## Dependencies
- Access to the toy language transpiler and execution engine
- Syntax highlighting rules from the VS Code extension
- A suitable web-based code editor component

## Open Questions
- Should there be limits on execution time or resource usage for complex code?
