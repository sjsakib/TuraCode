# Research: Toy Language Playground

## Code Editor Component Options

### Option 1: Monaco Editor
- **Description**: The editor that powers VS Code, available as a standalone component
- **Pros**:
  - Rich feature set (syntax highlighting, code completion, etc.)
  - Well-documented and actively maintained
  - Direct support for TextMate grammars which VS Code uses for syntax highlighting
  - Can leverage existing VS Code extension grammar rules
- **Cons**:
  - Relatively large bundle size (~1MB minified)
  - May be overkill for a simple playground
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium
- **Documentation**: [Monaco Editor GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor)

### Option 2: CodeMirror
- **Description**: Versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser
- **Pros**:
  - Lighter weight than Monaco
  - Good syntax highlighting support
  - Actively maintained
  - Flexible configuration
- **Cons**:
  - Might require adaptation work to use VS Code extension's grammar
  - Less feature-rich than Monaco out of the box
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium
- **Documentation**: [CodeMirror Website](https://codemirror.net/)

### Option 3: Ace Editor
- **Description**: High performance code editor for the web
- **Pros**:
  - Good performance
  - Reasonable bundle size
  - Built-in syntax highlighting for many languages
- **Cons**:
  - Custom work needed to use VS Code extension's grammar
  - Less active development compared to Monaco or CodeMirror
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium
- **Documentation**: [Ace Editor GitHub](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace)

### Option 4: PrismJS + Textarea
- **Description**: Lightweight syntax highlighting library combined with HTML textarea
- **Pros**:
  - Very small bundle size
  - Simple to integrate
  - Handles syntax highlighting well
- **Cons**:
  - Textarea provides basic editing only (no line numbers, etc.)
  - Would need to build editor features manually
  - Additional work to adapt VS Code grammar
- **Integration Complexity**: High (for editor features), Low (for syntax highlighting)
- **Documentation**: [PrismJS Website](https://prismjs.com/)

## Recommendation

**Monaco Editor** is recommended for this project because:
1. It directly supports TextMate grammars used by VS Code extensions
2. It will provide the most consistent syntax highlighting experience with the VS Code extension
3. It includes advanced editor features (line numbers, folding, etc.) out of the box
4. Despite the larger bundle size, the benefits in development time and feature completeness outweigh the cost

If bundle size becomes a critical concern, CodeMirror would be the next best option, but would require additional work to adapt the VS Code extension's grammar rules.

## Transpiler and Execution Integration

### Approach
1. Import the parser/transpiler from the core package
2. Set up a execution context in the browser
3. Use the transpiled output to execute in a controlled environment
4. Capture console output and errors for display

### Considerations
- Error handling needs to be robust to prevent crashes
- A sandboxed execution environment may be needed for safety
- Performance monitoring for long-running code might be required

## Responsive Design Implementation

### Approach
1. Use Tailwind's responsive utilities (md:, lg:, etc.)
2. Implement a grid layout that changes from single to two columns based on breakpoints
3. Use flexbox for internal component layouts

### Breakpoints
- Default (mobile): Single column layout
- md (768px+): Two-column layout with approximately 60/40 split for editor/results

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Syntax Highlighting Integration**:
   - Extracting and adapting the grammar rules from the VS Code extension
   - Ensuring consistent highlighting between VS Code and the playground

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Gracefully handling syntax errors in the input code
   - Presenting runtime errors in a user-friendly way
   - Preventing playground crashes from bad user code

3. **Performance**:
   - Managing the editor's performance with larger code examples
   - Ensuring the transpilation and execution process is responsive
